## Abstract

The idea of this project is to create a quiz application that is similar to kahoot. This project isn't based on any of kahoot's code, but built anew from the ground up. There are three main components to the Pihoot project. First, you have the backend that stores all of the data about existing quizzes and running games. It also handles the communication between the web-based frontend and the Raspberry Pis. The web-based frontend is the second part of the project, which is intended to be used by the game master to create, update, edit, delete, play and host quizzes. The last and third part of the project is the Raspberry Pi that is used to answer the questions that appear on the screen that the game master uses to show what's going on. The Raspberry Pi uses four buttons and one LED to allow the player to push the buttons to answer a question and for the player to know what color they are from the LED (Players are identified by colors).
