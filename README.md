# Global Readme

## Contents

<!-- TODO(laniw): Update if needed. -->
Each of the parts of the pihoot project (frontend, pi and backend) are in their respective folders. Additionally, there's also the docs folder that should contain the api design doc, use cases and test cases/protocol. Each of the parts have a separate README that should contain a description of the project and a quick start guide to get that part working.

For further documentation and retrospectives please head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/joelbieli/pihoot/wiki)
